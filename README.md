## Overview
The goal of this repository is to help developers master advanced React concepts by providing practical examples, best practices, and strategies. The repository is organized into multiple chapters, where each chapter covers a different topic from the book *Advanced React*.

Key topics include:
- Advanced React patterns
- Performance optimizations
- Best-practice architectures
- In-depth investigations of React features

## Chapters
Each chapter corresponds to a chapter from the book and is contained in its own folder within the project. These chapters focus on specific React techniques, strategies, or optimizations.

| Chapter   | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Chapter 1 | Introduction to Advanced React Concepts |
| Chapter 2 | Performance Optimizations in React |
| Chapter 3 | Managing State at Scale |
| Chapter 4 | Advanced conﬁguration with render props |
| Chapter 5 | Memoization with useMemo, useCallback and React.memo |
| ...       | ... |

## Tech Stack
This project uses the following tech stack:

- **React** - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **Vite** - A fast development server and build tool
- **TypeScript** - Strongly typed JavaScript
- **pnpm** - Fast, disk space-efficient package manager

## Best Practices

Throughout this project, the following best practices are followed:

* Emphasis on clean code and readable architecture 
* Use of TypeScript for type safety and maintainability 
* Focus on performance optimization with techniques such as memoization, lazy loading, and code splitting 
* Implementation of React hooks to simplify state management and side effects 
* Following the Component-driven development approach
